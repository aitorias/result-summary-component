### What I learned

I have learned to design elements using gradients to give a touch of design and modernity to my components.

```css
.userScore {
  align-items: center;
  aspect-ratio: 1/1;
  background: linear-gradient(var(--violet-blue), var(--persian-blue));
  border-radius: 50%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 140px;
}
```
